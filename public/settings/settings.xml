		<![CDATA[
			Fight Gym started as a small Martial Arts studio in a back street lane way of Manly in 1994. Within a year our members started dominating fight events in the local area. We started getting noticed by local media and it wasn't long before athletes from other sports came to us for cross training.
			Not surprisingly, our membership grew week by week. So much so that Fight Gym needed more space. Today, Fight Gym has two locations and has plans to expand further.
			Fight Gym is renowned for the class of our fighters. We have amateur and professional champions at all levels from novice to World Champions.
			The bulk of our membership however, is made up of ordinary people who want to train in an extraordinary environment. You see, even though you may never fight in the ring, sometimes the challenges of everyday life are just like a fight. At Fight Gym we believe that training for mediocrity simply isn't good enough. Our members deserve the best and that's what we deliver... the best... every single day... every single session.
			If you cant make it to either of our locations at Manly Beach or Sydney City, keep an eye out for us in your area soon. Better still, drop us a line for suggestions on where you would like to see the next Fight Gym open.
